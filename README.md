# MovieApp

- Hi there, I built MovieApp by using UIKit framework and MVVN design pattern, 

- Popular movies are listed on the main page with CollectionView.

- Favourite Movies could select by details view then shows your favourite movies with CollectionView. 

- User can save, delete and reorder their favorite movies, I used UserDefaults structure for adding favorite movies.

- I used Swift Package Manager  with the support of URLSession to contact Themoviedb API
